<div class="textblock"><p><code>drcachesim</code> is one of the few simulators to support multiple processes. This feature requires an out-of-process simulator and inter-process communication. A single-process design would incur less overhead. Thus, we expect <code>drcachesim</code> to pay for its multi-process support with potentially unfavorable performance versus single-process simulators.</p>
<p>When comparing cache hits, misses, and miss rates across simulators, the details can vary substantially. For example, some other simulators (such as <code>cachegrind</code>) do not split memory references that cross cache lines into multiple hits or misses, while <code>drcachesim</code> does split them. Instructions that reference multiple memory words on the same cache line (such as <code>ldm</code> on ARM) are considered to be single accesses by <code>drcachesim</code>, while other simulators (such as <code>cachegrind</code>) may split the accesses into separate pieces. A final example involves string loop instructions on x86. <code>drcachesim</code> considers only the first iteration to involve an instruction fetch (presenting subsequent iterations as a "non-fetched instruction" which the simulator ignores: the basic_counts tool does show these as a separate statistics), while other simulators (incorrectly) issue a fetch to the instruction cache on every iteration of the string loop. </p>
